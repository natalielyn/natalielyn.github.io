# Day 16

Today I did some review on node.js and express, but I spent alot of time on getting my feet wet with React. Tomorrow I want to follow along a tutorial I found and build a to-do app using react.
Today I learned that React in a javaScript library used for building front end applications. I learned how to use JSX which has similar syntax to html,and allows you to put html into a javaScript file.
