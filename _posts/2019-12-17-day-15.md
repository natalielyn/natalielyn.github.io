# Day 15

Today I created a color guessing game application following along a tutorial by Colt Steele. It uses html, css, and javaScript.
I re enforced some simple javascript functions, callback functions, event listeners, refactoring the code, and also how to select elements using DOM manipulation.
I also learned why its important to include webkit-transition and moz-transition in css. They are used incase a  certain browser doesnt properly display the transitions, its like a backup display option.
Tomorrow I want to follow along with a node.js/express tutorial and perhaps build a server from scratch again to re-solidify that process.
