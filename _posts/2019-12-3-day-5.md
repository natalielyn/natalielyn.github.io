# Day 5

**What did you work on today?**
Today I was finished my salmon cookies project by adding the chart JS and using SMACSS for my css files
**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**
Tomorrow I plan on moving on to the 301 review project
**Reflection: what did you learn/re-enforce?**
Re-enforced using chart js, I havent touched it in awhile so it was nice to review using it.
