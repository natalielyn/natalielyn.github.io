# Day 4

**What did you work on today?**
Today I was able to get my Salmon Cookies project to properly display the data, which was something I was struggling with yesterday.
**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**
Tomorrow I plan on completely finishing the salmon cookies project, all I need to do for that is impliment the chart JS. and I would like to look at the 301 project assignment and get started on that.
**Reflection: what did you learn/re-enforce?**
I figured out by looking at some of my classmates code that I wasn't properly attaching my j Query to the proper elements and thats why it wasn't rendering on to the front end. Also learned that j Query workeds both with the html tags and just the element names by themselves. Just a fun fact.
