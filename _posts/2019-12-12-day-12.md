# Day 12

Today I continued working on the group design project. I worked on the reviews page and using flexbox to align the different sections for each review of a particular jacket. I also got a new laptop so I spent alot of today going back through 201 and 301 and following the computer set up guides. Tomorrow I will continue working on the design project.
Today I re-enforced the use of flex box and getting more comfortable with it. I am finding it easier to know which flex commands will do what and I am not having to check the documentation as much to assist me.
