# Day 9

Today I continued to work on the trails section of my city-explorer-app, that I didn't get to finish over the weekend, and tried to resolve my issues with heroku. I also spent a good majority of my time preparing for an interview I have tomorrow.
Tomorrow I plan on fixing my heroku issues and completing the 301 project, and also looking at this weeks design project and discussing with my team how we want to appraoch that.
