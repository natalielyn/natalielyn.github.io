# Day 10

Today I spent time looking over the 2 assignments due this weekend. I talked with my team for the design project and cloned my teams repo to work on my section of the project. I also played around with some react intro tutorials for fun.
Tomorrow I plan on working on the design project, and perhaps work on my portfolio as well.
Today I re enforced some flex box concepts in preperation for the design project
