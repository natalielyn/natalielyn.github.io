# Day 13

Today I got the majority of my part of the design project completed, I learned how to fit images into a pre-determined space without causing it to stretch, but to just fill the space and use the css property overflow: hidden; to hide the rest of that image from the space.
This weekend I plan and finishing some small adjustments I need to make to the page I am working on, and also updating my portfolio page.
