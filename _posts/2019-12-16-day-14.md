# Day 14

Today I finished setting up my new laptop with the computer setup prework from 201 and 301, and also cloned all my previous class projects into my new directory system. I started on the 401 prework with the computer setup, but still have a bit to do. Tomorrow I plan on getting all my dev enviroment tools required for 401 installed and ready to go, and start trucking away on the rest of the 401 prework.
Today I re-enforced what all my dev enviroment tools are, and what they do, and why I need them. At the start of 201 I remember installing all these tools but not knowing what they are, now I can go bsack and understand what each componant is and what its doing, which is nice.
