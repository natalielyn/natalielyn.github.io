# Day 7

**What did you work on today?**
Today I got started on my city explorer rebuild assignment, I created the initial file structure and got the basics of my server dependencies
**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**
Tomorrow I plan on going forward with the city explorer project in creating the constructor functions and the API routing and hopefully completeing the project.
**Reflection: what did you learn/re-enforce?**
Re-enforced setting up a server and remembering all the dependencies required without checking my previous work.
