# Day 17

Today I worked through a tutorial that uses node.js, express and react to build a todo app. I learned how to set up a react app project and how to use the proper syntax of jsx in the application.
Tomorrow I plan of completing the 401 pre work, and if I have time finishing the to do application I started today, because I have not yet finished it.
